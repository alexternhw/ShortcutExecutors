# ShortcutExecutors

This is an extension for [Shortcut Creator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alextern.shortcuthelper) app.
It executes different actions from shortcuts which are created by Shortcut Creator.    

The separate component with open code is used because the functionality requires serior permissions which I don't want to 
add to Shortcut Creator. In this case any user can check the flow and confirm that there is no any malicious code. 

The code is open and you can use it under [Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/alexternhw/ShortcutExecutors/blob/master/LICENSE).

Any suggestions about additional actions are welcome, however the component is intented for actions which can be started by
users from shortcuts.
